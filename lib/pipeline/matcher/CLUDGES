Things that have been moved around or changed.


getFieldDottedOrArray -> ElementPath.getFieldDottedOrArray (was unattached function, now static function on ElementPath class)
isAllDigits -> ElementPath.isAllDigits ( now static function )


Status objects are now generic objects having a 'code' property that is a string of the error code that mongo uses (e.g. {code:'OK'}).

StatusWith is now rolled into status as a result field. status.getValue() is now status.result

debugString takes one argument 'level', as does debugAddSpace. Debug statements are printed to console.debug()


verify is a macro function that throws an exception if the input is falsey, with the current file and lineno, so there is no need for the function itself

.get() returns a copy of whatever called it. Since we don't manually manage memory, we don't need this.

.release() is manual memory management, it gets dropped.

obj.reset( arg ) is replaced with obj = arg; Everything else that happens in reset is manual memory management.

elementPath iteration is now encapsulated inside the elementPath class as a static method. It needs an input function to check the item at the end of the path.
